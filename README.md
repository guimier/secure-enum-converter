This repository contains several libraries in different languages which attempt
to help with the problem of bidirectional conversion between enumerations.

The following implementations are currently available:

  - [C++](cpp/README.md), using both the templating system and the preprocessor.
  - [Rust](rust/README.md), using a procedural macro to generate implementations from a small DSL.
